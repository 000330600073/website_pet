Protection of pet (website)
articles on the protection of animals for all time 1,320,000
1) 2010 275,000 - The result shows a high relevance as laws on the rights of pets began to be issued around the world.
2) 2016 - 75 500 - As you can see, the results have decreased, but the relevance remains. So many results are due to the fact that some countries such as Crimea, New Zealand have adopted a law to protect against cruelty to pets.
3) 2019 - 19,300 - And then even Russia began to act, and on January 1, 2019, a law on the responsible treatment of animals came into force, the adoption of which in Russia had been waiting for 8 years. Of course, Kazakhstan did not stay on the sidelines, but inaction also continues.
4) 2020 - 20 400 - There is no single Law on the Responsible Treatment of Animals in the Republic of Kazakhstan. Moreover, the practice of animal protection organizations and volunteers shows that often existing legislative acts are ineffective in protecting animal rights.


1) Relevant - Many countries have enacted protection laws so results have decreased,
But the relevance remains in those countries in which the law was not spun, for example, Kazakhstan.
2) Interesting - many people who have pets and even those who do not are interested
3) In demand - in Kazakhstan in recent years, it has been in demand due to public resonance on articles about animal abuse
4) Achievable - we believe that with the common efforts and efforts of bloggers, it will be possible to cause the intended result.
